# Abdullah's Personal & Professional Portfolio

This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, multi-page site designed to showcase my skills and experience in both **Financial Technology** and **Digital Marketing**. The site is built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on clean code and a modern user interface.
